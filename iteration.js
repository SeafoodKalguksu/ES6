// for - loops through a block of code a number of times

// do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

// The for...in statement iterates over all enumerable properties of an object that are keyed by strings (ignoring ones keyed by Symbols), including inherited enumerable properties.
// key: the key of each property of the object on each iteration.
// object: Object whose ***non-Symbol enumerable properties*** are iterated over.

}

// The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects,
// including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects (e.g., arguments
// or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables.
// value: the value of each distinct property of the object.
// iterable: Object whose iterable properties are iterated.

// NOTE: The forEach loop is another type of for loop in JavaScript. However, forEach() is actually an array method, so it can only be used exclusively with arrays. ***There is also no way to stop or break a forEach loop. If you need that type of behavior in your loop, youâ€™ll have to use a basic for loop.***
